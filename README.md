# PDGDiffTool - SENG 541 A5

## Introduction
In this project, we are developing a software application that can compute the matches and differences between two java methods, in terms of the program dependence graphs (PDG) of those methods. We are going to calculate the PDGs and then convert the data into a programmatic form. Then we need to decide on a similarity measurement between nodes and edges. A working software computes a good matching of nodes and edges within the two input PDGs. The matching will show the semantic similarities and differences between the two PDGs. Lastly, data must be presented in a reasonable way to show the results of the software. 

## Environment Setup
1. Eclipse IDE
2. Java 13 SDK
